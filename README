FREESURFER FOR MULTIMODAL SUBJECTS =================================================
  queue reconall -all (freesurfer) for subjects that haven't been run

  rawdir     /data/Luna1/Raw/MultiModal/*/*mprage*/      where structural scans are found
  niidir     /data/Luna1/Multimodal/ANTI/*/mprage/       where structural nii.gz is saved
  FSdir      /data/Luna1/Multimodal/FS_Subjects/         where freesurfer puts its output
          
          wallace:/data/Luna1 is gromit:/raid/r3/p2/Luna


FILES ==============================================================================
  surf.sh            ---    check for subjects for which freesurfer has not been run
                             -> give rundate of incomplete runs
                             -> check for nii in ANTI/mprage, create if DNE
                             -> qsub subjects that haven't been run

  queReconall.sh     ---     qsub executed script
                              -> set environment to gromit 
                              -> run reconall


  ni_path_local.bash ---     mode of $LUNADIR/ni_tools/ni_path.bash
                           -> check which host and set LUNADIR before adding paths


NOTES ==============================================================================

  o  stderr/out in ./logs/ (directed by -e and -o of qsub)


  o  log is in ANTI subj folder
     can watch process with tail
       e.g.
       tail -f /data/Luna1/Multimodal/ANTI/10909/10909_fsrecon.log

  o  symbolic links found issue with nfs naming across mounts on different machines (using torque)
     corrected with
      surf.sh |perl -lne 'print $1 if m/UNFINISHED:\s+(\d+) s/' | xargs -n1 recon-all -balabels -label-exvivo-ec -sid
      
      (only redo last two steps [where fsaverage is needed, but sym link broken])
